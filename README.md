# ComputationalUncertaintyHPC
This repo is associated with experiments done on NCSA's Blue Waters system to improve our understanding of computational uncertainty and reproducibility.
* Due to the non-deterministic nature of this experimental procedure, we expect scientists attempting to replicate this work will only replicate to one or two significant digits for each experiment. These experiments were carried out during the later half of 2016 and so a researcher attempting to replicate this work on Blue Waters may find specific versions of compilers we used (and even Blue Waters itself) unavailable in the future.
